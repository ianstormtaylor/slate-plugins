This repository contains a few of [my](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor) Slate plugins in a single monorepo to keep them easier to develop.

<br/>

### Plugins

- [`slate-auto-replace`](./packages/slate-auto-replace)
- [`slate-collapse-on-escape`](./packages/slate-collapse-on-escape)
- [`slate-drop-or-paste-images`](./packages/slate-drop-or-paste-images)
- [`slate-paste-linkify`](./packages/slate-paste-linkify)
- [`slate-soft-break`](./packages/slate-soft-break)

_Note: this is not an "official" set of plugins, just ones that I've happened to need and have made. If you have an idea for a plugin, don't pull request it here, you should keep them in your own repos. (Feel free to use this monorepo as a template for your own!)_
